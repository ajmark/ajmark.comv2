                <h2>Women in Medicine</h2>
                <p>This was a semester long project where my team worked with
                a real client to help them create a web presence to promote their
                organization. Our client was the Women in Medicine group of Allegheny
                County (WiM), who's mission is to promote the welfare of women working in the 
                medical profession. The purpose of this website is to provide resources for 
                members of this organization and potential new members in regards to balancing
                family life with work life, professional networking and promoting community involvement.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>Our goal was to help WiM by designing them a website and developing a functional
                prototype to help them accomplish their organizational objective. The first steps of our design
                process was to determine how to structure their website. We conducted a series of user tests on 
                members of our target audience, women professionals in health care, which included using card sorting
                and label testing techniques.</p>

                <p>After we finished our user studies, our team was able to begin the design phase of our project.
                This is where we began to develop several iterations of wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and eventually
                the actual source code for the website prototype.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>We presented our findings from the user testing and performing a walkthrough of our prototype to our clients
                and they were happy with the results. We got excellent feedback from them and they were excited to use these ideas 
                in the actual development of their website. Through this project, I learned how user research can have a significant
                impact on a project and spending the extra time to conduct such studies can truly make a difference in the final outcome.</p>
