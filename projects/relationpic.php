                <h2>Relationpic</h2>
                <p>Relationpic is a mobile application that allows couples to collaboratively
                share and create photo albums. Photos are stored via the cloud so that users do not
                have to keep everying saved locally. It simplifies the process of managing pictures from 
                several different devices by allowing users to consolidate everying into a single
                storage location.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We started off the design process by trying to determine who our target audience was.
                We created personas, wrote use cases and sketched storyboards to help us better understand the
                people we were tyring to design this application for.</p>

                    <img class="screenshot-main" src="../public/assets/projectImages/relationpic/persona.png">
                    <figcaption>Fig B. - Persona</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>After determining our target audience, we began the design process with constructing wireframes
                and high-fidelity screens of what we imagined the mobile application to look like.</p>
                <figure class="relationpic-wireframe">
                    <img class="screenshot-main" src="../public/assets/projectImages/relationpic/wireframe_album.png">
                    <figcaption>Fig C. - Album Wireframe</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure class="relationpic-wireframe">
                    <img class="screenshot-main" src="../public/assets/projectImages/relationpic/pictures.png">
                    <figcaption>Fig D. - Pictures Screen</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>This was an interesting project because it required me to step outside of my comfort zone.
                I was able to practice brainstorming and ideation using methods such as affinity diagraming and personas.
                Thas was helpful in that it made me focus specifically on the problem I was solving for and not to
                get distracted by other extraneous details.</p>
