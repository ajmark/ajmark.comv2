                <h2>Animal Rescue League Website Redesign</h2>
                <p>This was a school project with a mock client. The purpose of the project was to use 
                what I have learned about typography and grid systems to redesign a website for an organization. 
                I was assigned the Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh. I had to make special considerations for the 
                specific content and the design objectives that the clients wanted to include in the website. 
                A large part of this project involved understanding the interactive parts of web design and how different 
                layouts would offer the best experience for the users.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>One of the main goals of the Animal Rescue League client was to increase the number of views 
                on the adoption page to help improve adoption numbers from the center. Some of the pain points of 
                the current website are that there is no clear call to action, the information is unorganized and 
                irrelevant to their listed categories, and that there are too many navigation options on the homepage 
                for the user to easily make a decision from. Through my iterations of the homepage, I made the navigation 
                to the adoption page the focus of the website. I attempted to create a clear call to action to visit the 
                adoption page and to create a better system to browse available animals.</p>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I learned how to find and develop purposes for a design and be able to defend my design
                based on that rationale. There had to be a reason for every feature of my website redesign and it was good practice for
                a skill I had previously not been accustomed to.</p>
